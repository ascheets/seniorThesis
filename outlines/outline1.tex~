\section{Components of a Numerical Solution Method}

\begin{easylist}[enumerate]

& Mathematical Model
&& First of all, what are you modeling?
&&& Incompressible fluid flow in a channel
&&& What are the physical implications of the fluid adjectives used here?
&& Why are you modeling this?
&& How are you modeling it, what set of equations are you using?
&& Why are you modeling it this way?
& Discretization Method
&& I am using finite differences to discretize the equations
&& What does it mean to ``discretize''?
&& How do finite differences discretize the equations in question?
&& How well do finite differences match the physics in question?
& Coordinate and Basis Vector System
&& Working in Cartesian Coordinates
&& Why are you working in cartesian coordinates?
&& What would change if using different coordinate system?
&& ``Basis in which vectors and tensors will be defined''?
& Numerical Grid
& Finite Approximations
& Solution Method
& Convergence Criteria
