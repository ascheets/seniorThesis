The goal of my thesis is to translate theory on fluid flow to computational models. To analytically model fluid flow, one must be able to relate the fluid properties, pressure, density, and temperature, and conserve mass, fluid momentum, and fluid energy. There exists a myriad of different flow types, and my thesis will concentrate on laminar, incompressible flow in particular. Laminar flow is non-turbulent and is therefore easier to solve for. To say that a flow is incompressible is to make the assumption that the fluid is of uniform density. Despite the existence of adequate fluid solvers, the abstraction of the details of the modeling process increases the probability of making poor assumptions when modeling a particular fluid flow.
