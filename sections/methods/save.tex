\begin{equation}
u_{i+1} = u_i + \Delta{x}\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}\bigg|_i + \frac{\Delta{x^2}}{2}\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}}\bigg|_i + \frac{\Delta{x^3}}{6}\frac{\partial^3{u}}{\partial{x^3}}\bigg|_i + H
\end{equation}

In this case, $\Delta{x} = x_{i+1} - x_i$, which is positive.

Backward Taylor Expansion

\begin{equation}
u_{i-1} = u_i - \Delta{x}\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}\bigg|_i + \frac{\Delta{x^2}}{2}\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}}\bigg|_i - \frac{\Delta{x^3}}{6}\frac{\partial^3{u}}{\partial{x^3}}\bigg|_i + H
\end{equation}

In this case, $\Delta{x} = x_{i-1} - x_i$, which is negative, hence the alternating signs.

Wanting to solve for the second derivative $\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}} \bigg|_i$.

We could solve from only forward, or only backward.
The forward and backward expansions produce \textit{one sided} approximations.
For a higher order of accuracy, find a central difference approximation to the second derivative.
This can be done by adding the forward and backward expansions, and then solving for $\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}} \bigg|_i$.

Add them:

\begin{equation}
u_{i+1} + u_{i-1} = 2u_i + \frac{\Delta{x^2}}{2}\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}}\bigg|_i + \frac{\Delta{x^4}}{6}\frac{\partial^4{u}}{\partial{x^4}}\bigg|_i + H
\end{equation}

Notice how the terms with opposing signs cancel out.

Solve for $\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}} \bigg|_i$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}} \bigg|_i = \frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{\Delta{x^2}} - \frac{\Delta{x^2}}{6}\frac{\partial^4{u}}{\partial{x^4}}\bigg|_i + H
\end{equation}

Dropping the higher order terms, we are left with a central approximation to the second order derivative:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}} \bigg|_i = \frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{\Delta{x^2}}
\end{equation}

The central difference scheme takes into account points on both sides of $x_i$.
