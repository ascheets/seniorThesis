\title{Writing A Fluid Solver From First}

\section{Introduction}

This thesis is an investigation of the components of a ``fluid solver''.
I have put ``fluid solver'' in quotations because, the topic of fluid solvers is an extremely broad topic, which rests upon an even broader topic, fluid mechanics.
In a generic sense, fluid solvers encapsulate the computational methods designed to solve the problems of fluid mechanics.
Despite the extensive nature of fluid mechanics and the accompanying computational methods, the well-established classification system of fluids and fluid flow allows one to focus on a smaller subset of fluid phenomena, thankfully prolonging the explosion of one's own head from information overload.
The goal of this thesis is to concretely identify one particular subset of fluid flow, then thoroughly present a selection of computational methods that might be applied to ``solve'' for that fluid flow.
I have put ``solve'' in quotations here, because, ``solving'' for fluid flow is yet another ambiguous term in the realm of fluid mechanics.
When one has decided which particular fluid to study, ``solving'' for that fluid means acquiring information pertaining to that fluid through some means.
The information of a fluid of interest, which depends on the application of modeling the fluid in the first place, can include the velocity of fluid flow, the pressure, or temperature of the fluid.
This information can be acquired through experiment or through theoretical analysis.
Computational fluid dynamics is arguably a hybrid of these two techniques, and the components of this hybrid technique will be the subject matter of this thesis.
