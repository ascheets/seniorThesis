\subsection{Discretizing the Navier-Stokes Equations}

With all of the different types of finite differences at our disposal we can now come up with an approximation to the Navier-Stokes Equations.
In the last sections, forward, backward, and central finite differences were presented for first and second order derivatives.
Our goal is to approximate the component equations of the Navier-Stokes vector equation using those finite differences.
The fluid flow simulation is 2-dimensional, thus, we only need to consider two of the component equations from the Navier-Stokes Equations:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{t}} + u\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}} + v\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} = g_x - \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}} + \nu \bigg( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial{x}^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial{y}^2} \bigg)
\label{eq:exs1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{t}} + u\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} + v\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}} = g_y -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}} + \nu \bigg( \frac{\partial^2v}{\partial{x}^2} + \frac{\partial^2v}{\partial{y}^2} \bigg)
\end{equation*}

Each derivative in the component equations could be discretized differently, that is, we have a choice as to whether we approximate the derivatives with forward, backward, or central differences.
The particular type of finite difference we decide to use for a particular derivative is known as the \textit{numerical scheme} for that derivative.
The derivatives of the component equations correspond to physical processes and the numerical scheme we choose will depend on the process in question.
In other words, some numerical schemes are better approximations to certain physical processes than others.
For example, the most accurate and stable approximation to the convection terms is a backwards finite difference.
Some analysis is required to show why this is the case, but the best finite difference option is a little more obvious for other terms.


The third equation we will need to discretize is the Poisson pressure equation which ensures the divergence of the velocity will be zero.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2p}{\partial{x}^2} + \frac{\partial^2p}{\partial{y}^2} = \rho \bigg[ \frac{1}{\Delta{t}}\bigg(\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}} + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}} \bigg) - \bigg(\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}} \bigg)^2 - 2\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} - \bigg(\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}  \bigg)^2  \bigg]
\label{eq:exs2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Unsteady Term}

The notation used when discretizing continous equations is key to identifying the type of derivative being taken, and the numerical scheme being used to take that derivative.
To demonstrate the discretization notation, consider the unsteady term of the component equations.
The unsteady term in the Navier-Stokes Equations is $\frac{\partial{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial{t}}$, which corresponds to $\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{t}}$ and $\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{t}}$ in the component equations above.
It is useful to discretize the unsteady term using a forward difference.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{t}} \approx \frac{u_{i,j}^{n+1} - u_{i,j}^{n}}{\Delta{t}}
\end{equation}

The $u$ terms in the expression above represent the x-component of velocity.
The subscripts $i$ and $j$, indicate the position on the numerical grid where the velocity is being calculated.
The superscript $n$ indicates the moment in time in which we are considering the velocity.
One should notice that the indices indicating position, $i,j$ are constant, in contrast to the index indicating time, $n$.
This is a characteristic of the partial derivative with respect to time; time evolves while the other variables are held constant.
By discretizing the unsteady term using a forward difference, the velocity one step forward in time, $u_{i}^{n+1}$, is accessible.
Thus, solving for $u_{i}^{n+1}$, stepping the velocity field forward in time is possible.

\subsection{Convective Terms}

The convection terms from the component equations are the following:

\begin{equation}
u\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}} + v\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
u\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} + v\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}
\end{equation*}

The convective terms are discretized using a backward difference approach.
Explain why this is the case?
The discretized form of the convective components is the following:

\begin{equation}
u_{i,j}^n\frac{u^n_{i,j} - u^n_{i-1,j}}{\Delta{x}} + v_{i,j}^n\frac{u^n_{i,j} - u^n_{i,j-1}}{\Delta{y}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
u_{i,j}^n\frac{v^n_{i,j} - v^n_{i-1,j}}{\Delta{x}} + v_{i,j}^n\frac{v^n_{i,j} - v^n_{i,j-1}}{\Delta{y}}
\end{equation*}

The partial derivatives with respect to x have changing $i$ indices and are constant in $j$.
The partials with respect to y are just the opposite, constant in $i$ and variable in $j$.

\subsection{Pressure Terms}

The pressure terms from the component equations are the following:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}}
\end{equation*}

The partial derivatives of pressure with respect to x and y are approximated using a central difference approximation.
Explain why this is the case?
The discretized form of the pressure terms are the following:

\begin{equation}
\frac{p^n_{i+1,j} - p^n_{i-1,j}}{\Delta{2x}} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\frac{p^n_{i,j+1} - p^n_{i,j-1}}{\Delta{2y}}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Diffusion Terms}

The diffusive, viscous terms from the component equations are the following:

\begin{equation}
\nu \bigg( \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial{x}^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial{y}^2} \bigg)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\nu \bigg( \frac{\partial^2v}{\partial{x}^2} + \frac{\partial^2v}{\partial{y}^2} \bigg)
\end{equation*}

The diffusive terms are discretized using a second order, central difference derivative approximation.
Explain why this is the case?
The discretized form of the diffusive terms is the following:

\begin{equation}
\nu \Bigg( \frac{u^n_{i+1,j} -2u^n_{i,j} +  u^n_{i-1,j}}{\Delta{x^2}} + \frac{u^n_{i,j+1} -2u^n_{i,j} + u^n_{i,j-1}}{\Delta{y^2}} \Bigg)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\nu \Bigg( \frac{v^n_{i+1,j} -2v^n_{i,j} + v^n_{i-1,j}}{\Delta{x^2}} + \frac{v^n_{i,j+1} -2v^n_{i,j} + v^n_{i,j-1}}{\Delta{y^2}} \Bigg)
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Poisson Equation}

The left hand side of the Poisson pressure equation, (\ref{eq:exs2}) consists of two second order, spatial derivatives.
These derivatives are discretized using central, second order finite difference approximations:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2p}{\partial{x}^2} \approx \Bigg( \frac{p^n_{i+1,j} -2p^n_{i,j} + p^n_{i-1,j}}{\Delta{x^2}} \Bigg)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial^2p}{\partial{y}^2} \approx \Bigg( \frac{p^n_{i,j+1} -2p^n_{i,j} + p^n_{i,j-1}}{\Delta{y^2}} \Bigg)
\end{equation*}

The right hand side of the pressure equation consists of first order, spatial derivatives of the velocity components.
These derivatives are all approximated uisng central, first order finite differences.
The pattern in describing finite differences should be apparent at this point.
Including the discretized version of the right hand side of the pressure equation here would be more redundant than helpful.
